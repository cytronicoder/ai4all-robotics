# Stanford AI4ALL Robotics Project

We explored autonomous aircraft taxiing in a simulated environment. The project focuses on the taxiing phase using the X-Plane 11 simulator for controlled testing. Autonomous aircraft contribute to climate change mitigation and address economic concerns, such as the pilot shortage. The system integrates data-driven techniques (neural networks) with classical controls (PID) to ensure high safety standards. The objective is to position the aircraft collinear with the runway's centerline using a camera on the nose of the plane, a neural network for estimation, and a PID controller for planning and control. The system performed well under different environmental conditions, but showed inconsistencies when dealing with shadows.

## Roadmap
